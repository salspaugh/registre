<h2>Explanation of contents</h2>

<p>This document describes (1) some logged Tableau events that are missing some information, and (2) some Tableau interactions that are not logged, in Tableau version 8.2. The missing information is identified with respect to our ultimate goal, so not all information that is missing from the logs is described, only that which is relevant to our goal. Our goal is to be able to reconstruct user actions and the application or interface state of Tableau from the Tableau event logs (contained in the log.txt file), for the purpose of building visualization recommendation tools. </p>

<p>The events that we focus on are those that are keyed <code>command-pre</code> (i.e., <code>"k":"command-pre"</code>) because we have surmised that these events are the only ones that reflect user interaction that is relevant to our purposes. We believe these events to be almost identical to <code>"k":"command-post"</code> events with the exception of the timestamp (<code>ts</code>) and key (<code>k</code>), so if one of these events is changed, it may be desirable that the other is changed as well.</p>

<p>There are two main sections to this document. The first section, <a href="#events-that-are-missing-information">Events that are missing information</a>, contains a list of currently logged Tableau events that are missing information and a description of what information needs to be added. The second section, <a href="#interactions-that-are-not-logged">Interactions that are not logged</a>, contains a list of information that is not currently logged, but might be useful to log.</p>

<p>We have noted that one consistently missing piece of information is what visualization is shown after a user takes an action that would change the visualization. However, we understand that this information may be proprietary, and therefore not loggable.</p>

<p>This is a work-in-progress document. Not all Tableau events or interactions have been evaluated for completeness for our purposes. Events may be added to the list -- when they are, they will be marked as "NEW", accompanied by the date added. </p>

<p><strong>Summary of assumptions</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>All relevant events are contained in the log.txt file contained in the Tableae log directory.</li>
<li>The events are logged from Tableau version is 8.2 or versions with a comparable logging format</li>
<li>The only type of events which reflect user interaction of interest are <code>"k":"command-pre"</code> events.</li>
<li>The <code>"k":"command-pre"</code> events are all nearly identical to <code>"k":"command-post"</code> events in terms of parameter information; only things like timestamp (<code>ts</code>) and key (<code>k</code>) information differ. </li>
<li>There is no "verbose mode" or other means to induce Tableau to log more information than is done by default.</li>
<li>It is acceptable to log the visualization produced in response to relevant interactions, though this is not usually done.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Events that are missing information</h2>

<h3>Create calculation</h3>

<p><strong>Event key:</strong> <code>tabui:create-calculation-ui</code> </p>

<p><strong>Example event:</strong></p>

<p><code>
{"ts":"2014-09-03T18:13:31.666","pid":13594,"tid":"6a7af","sev":"info","req":"-","sess":"-","site":"-","user":"-","k":"command-pre","v":{"name":"tabui:create-calculation-ui","args":"tabui:create-calculation-ui use-selector=\"true\""}}
</code></p>

<p><strong>Interaction description:</strong> 
When the user creates a calculated field based on functions of other fields, Tableau emits <code>tabui:create-calculation-ui</code> events.
The event notes that the calculation dialog was used <em>but not how the field was calculated</em>. This calculated field is also assigned an ID (based at least in part on the timestamp at the time of creation) that is used to refer to it in later events, such as <code>Calculation_6530903181331686</code>, which is referred to in the following <code>tabui:drop-ui</code> event:</p>

<p><code>
{"ts":"2014-09-03T18:16:04.019","pid":13594,"tid":"6a7af","sev":"info","req":"-","sess":"-","site":"-","user":"-","k":"command-pre","v":{"name":"tabui:drop-ui","args":"tabui:drop-ui drag-description=\"\" drag-source=\"drag-drop-schema\" drop-target=\"drag-drop-viz\" field-encodings=[{\"fn\": \"[On_Time_On_Time_Performance_2001_9 Extract].[sum:Calculation_6530903181331686:qk]\",\"encoding-type\": \"invalid-encoding\"}] is-copy=\"false\" is-dead-drop=\"false\" is-right-drag=\"false\" shelf-drag-source-position={\"is-override\": false} shelf-drop-context=\"none\" shelf-drop-target-position={\"shelf-type\": \"rows-shelf\",\"shelf-pos-index\": 2,\"is-override\": false} target-sheet=\"Sheet 1\""}}
</code></p>

<p><strong>Missing information to add:</strong></p>

</code></p>

<p><strong>Interaction description:</strong> An aggregated field (one that is labeled as AGG(Field), for example) is right-clicked, "Measure (Aggregation)" is highlighted and then an aggregation is selected. The event does not note what field the aggregation was changed on or what the aggregation was previously. </p>

<p><strong>Missing information to add:</strong></p>

<h2>Interactions that are not logged</h2>

<h3>Switch sheet</h3>

<p><strong>Interaction description:</strong> A sheet is selected via clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the interface or using keyboard shortcuts to navigate between tabs. There is currently no event for this as far as we can tell. This information would suffice in place of additional parameters for many of the other events that act on the current sheet and do not specify what sheet was acted on, because we would know what the current sheet is.  </p>

<p><strong>Missing information to add:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>An event describing what sheet was switched to</li>
</ul>

<h3>Menu open</h3>

<p><strong>Interaction description:</strong>  A user clicks on an interface element that pops up a menu list of possible options. Usually, when a user clicks on one of the options, an event is logged. However, it would be useful to know that a user opened a menu even if they selected no action, because this would allow the detection of "menu surfing".</p>

<p><strong>Missing information to add:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>An event describing what menu was opened</li>
</ul>
